# Char Text Editor

A lightweight, retro-inspired, single file, web-based code editor built with TypeScript, while aspiring to sprinkle in some JavaScript for plugins.

## Overview

Char is a simple, intuitive code editor designed for everyday coding tasks. It provides a distraction-full interface and essential features for editing code while maintaing its premise of being a single HTML file editor by using inline base64 encoding.

## Implemented features

* README.md

## TODO features

* Basic text editing capabilities (cut, copy, paste, undo, redo)
* Real-time syntax highlighting for popular programming languages
* Customizable font sizes, styles, and colors
* Line numbers and word count display
* Keyboard shortcuts for improved productivity

## Installation

To use Char, simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn. Then, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dr-Gomez/char-V8.git
cd char-V8
npm install
npm run build
open ./dist/index.html
```

note that you can copy this index.html file anywhere and use it as the code editor, although the the entire project with vite will be required for making any plugins / changes to the editor.
